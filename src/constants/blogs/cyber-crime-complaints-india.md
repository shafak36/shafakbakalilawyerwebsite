Before filing a complaint, gather all relevant information:

- Screenshots of the incident  
- URLs, email headers, or chat logs  
- Bank statements or transaction details (if financial fraud)  
- Device details (IP address, browser info, etc.)

The more evidence you provide, the stronger your case.

### 2. Visit the Cyber Crime Portal

- Submit the complaint and note the reference number

You can file anonymously for certain categories like child abuse or harassment.

For serious cases, especially involving financial loss or threats:

- Visit your nearest **cyber cell** or police station  
- Request to file an **FIR** under relevant sections of the IT Act and IPC
