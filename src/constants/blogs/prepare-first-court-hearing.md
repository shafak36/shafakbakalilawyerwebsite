## Introduction

Your first court hearing can feel overwhelming — especially if you’ve never been inside a courtroom before.  
Whether you’re involved in a **civil dispute** or facing a **criminal charge**, preparation is key to protecting your rights and making a strong impression.

This guide walks you through the essential steps to get ready for your first day in court.

## Understand the Nature of Your Case

Before you step into the courtroom, be clear about:

- **Type of case**: Civil (property, contracts, family matters) or criminal (offences under IPC or special laws)  
- **Stage of proceedings**: Is it a preliminary hearing, framing of charges, evidence stage, or final arguments?  
- **Your role**: Are you the plaintiff/complainant, defendant/accused, or a witness?

Knowing these details helps you and your lawyer plan your approach.

## Consult Your Lawyer Early

Your lawyer is your primary guide through the legal process. Before the hearing:

- Review your case file together  
- Clarify the strategy for the day  
- Understand possible questions or objections from the other side  
- Discuss courtroom etiquette and how to address the judge

## Organize Your Documents

Bring all relevant paperwork in an orderly manner:

- Case summons or notice  
- Identity proof  
- Copies of pleadings, FIR, or charge sheet  
- Evidence documents (contracts, receipts, photographs, etc.)  
- Any prior court orders

Use labeled folders or binders to avoid confusion during proceedings.

## Dress and Behave Professionally

Courtrooms demand respect and decorum:

- Wear formal, modest clothing (avoid flashy colors or casual wear)  
- Arrive at least 30 minutes early  
- Keep your phone on silent  
- Stand when addressing the judge and speak clearly

Your demeanor can influence how your credibility is perceived.

## Know the Courtroom Process

Familiarize yourself with what typically happens:

- **Civil cases**: May involve settlement talks, framing of issues, or scheduling of evidence  
- **Criminal cases**: Could include bail hearings, framing of charges, or witness examination  
- Listen carefully, avoid interrupting, and follow your lawyer’s cues

## Stay Calm and Focused

It’s natural to feel nervous, but remember:

- Breathe deeply and stay composed  
- Focus on facts, not emotions  
- Let your lawyer handle legal arguments unless you’re asked to speak

Confidence and clarity go a long way in court.
