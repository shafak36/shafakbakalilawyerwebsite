## Introduction

Buying property is one of the most significant investments you’ll make — and in India, it comes with a detailed legal process.  
Whether you’re purchasing a home, commercial space, or land, **property registration** and **due diligence** are essential to protect your rights and avoid future disputes.

This beginner’s guide explains the process, documents, and checks you need before finalizing a property deal.

## What Is Property Registration?

Property registration is the legal process of recording the ownership of a property in the government’s records.  
Under the **Registration Act, 1908**, all transactions involving the sale of immovable property worth more than ₹100 must be registered.

Registration ensures:

- Legal proof of ownership  
- Protection against fraud or disputes  
- Public record of the transaction

## Step-by-Step: Property Registration Process

1. **Sale Agreement**  
   Draft and sign a sale agreement outlining the terms, price, and conditions.

2. **Stamp Duty Payment**  
   Pay the applicable stamp duty based on the property’s market value or agreement value, whichever is higher.

3. **Visit the Sub-Registrar’s Office**  
   Both buyer and seller must be present with witnesses to execute the sale deed.

4. **Document Verification**  
   The Sub-Registrar verifies the documents, identity proofs, and payment receipts.

5. **Registration & Record Update**  
   Once registered, the property details are updated in government records, and the buyer receives the registered sale deed.

## Importance of Due Diligence

Due diligence is the process of verifying the property’s legal status before purchase. It helps avoid disputes, fraud, and financial loss.

Key checks include:

- **Title Verification**: Ensure the seller has a clear and marketable title.  
- **Encumbrance Certificate**: Confirms the property is free from legal dues or mortgages.  
- **Land Use & Zoning**: Check if the property complies with local land use regulations.  
- **Approvals & Permits**: Verify building plan approvals, occupancy certificates, and environmental clearances.  
- **Tax Records**: Ensure property tax payments are up to date.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Skipping title verification  
- Underestimating stamp duty and registration costs  
- Not checking for pending litigation  
- Ignoring local zoning laws  
- Relying solely on verbal assurances
