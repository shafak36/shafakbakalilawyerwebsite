## Introduction

Filing for divorce is a major life decision — emotionally, legally, and financially.  
If you're based in **Pune**, understanding the local legal landscape can make the process smoother and less overwhelming.

Whether you're considering mutual consent or contested divorce, this guide outlines **five key things** you should know before taking the first step.

## 1. Know the Grounds for Divorce

Under Indian law, divorce can be filed under various grounds depending on the personal laws applicable (Hindu Marriage Act, Special Marriage Act, etc.).

- **Mutual Consent Divorce**: Requires agreement from both spouses and a minimum separation period of one year.  
- **Contested Divorce**: Can be filed on grounds like cruelty, desertion, adultery, mental disorder, or conversion of religion.

Understanding which ground applies to your situation is crucial before filing.

## 2. Jurisdiction Matters

In Pune, divorce petitions are typically filed in the **Family Court** located at Shivajinagar.  
You must file in the jurisdiction where:

- You or your spouse currently reside  
- The marriage was solemnized  
- The couple last lived together

Filing in the correct jurisdiction avoids delays and procedural issues.

## 3. Documentation Is Key

Prepare all necessary documents before filing:

- Marriage certificate  
- Address proof of both parties  
- Photographs  
- Income and asset details  
- Evidence supporting grounds for divorce (if contested)

Having these ready speeds up the process and strengthens your case.

## 4. Child Custody & Maintenance

If children are involved, the court will prioritize their welfare.

- **Custody** can be joint or sole, depending on the circumstances.  
- **Maintenance** may be awarded to the spouse or children based on income and needs.

Discuss these aspects with your lawyer early to avoid surprises later.

## 5. Legal Counsel Is Essential

Divorce law can be complex, especially in contested cases.  
Hiring an experienced **family lawyer in Pune** ensures:

- Proper filing and representation  
- Protection of your rights  
- Guidance through mediation or court proceedings

Even in mutual consent cases, legal advice helps avoid missteps.

## Final Thoughts

Divorce is never easy, but being informed makes it manageable.  
If you're considering filing in Pune, take time to understand your options, gather your documents, and consult a trusted legal professional.
