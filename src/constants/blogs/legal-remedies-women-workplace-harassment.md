## Introduction

Workplace harassment is not only unethical — it’s illegal.  
In India, women are protected by strong legal frameworks that aim to ensure safety, dignity, and equality at work.  
Yet, many cases go unreported due to fear, stigma, or lack of awareness.

This guide empowers women to **recognize harassment**, understand their **legal rights**, and take action to protect themselves.

## What Counts as Workplace Harassment?

Workplace harassment can take many forms, including:

- **Sexual harassment**: Unwelcome physical contact, sexual advances, or inappropriate comments.  
- **Verbal abuse**: Insults, threats, or derogatory remarks.  
- **Discrimination**: Unequal treatment based on gender, marital status, or pregnancy.  
- **Hostile work environment**: Persistent behavior that makes it difficult to work.

## Key Legal Protections in India

### 1. The POSH Act, 2013
The **Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013** mandates:

- Formation of an **Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)** in organizations with 10+ employees.
